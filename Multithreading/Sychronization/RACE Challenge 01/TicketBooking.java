/*
 ðŸ’» Task: Simulate a Ticket Booking System (Race Condition Version)
    ðŸŽ¯ Your Objective
       1. Create a TicketBooking class with a bookTicket(String name, int seats) method.
       2. It should start with 10 seats available.
       3. Create 2 Threads simulating two users trying to book 7 tickets at the same time.
       4. Donâ€™t use synchronized in the first version â€” we want to see what happens in a race condition.
